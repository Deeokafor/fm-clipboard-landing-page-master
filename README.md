## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

I learned how to use React props to make components more flexible by passing in different types of data. Additionally, I discovered how negative margins can be used in CSS to adjust the positioning of images for better layout control.

### Continued development

I plan to further strengthen my understanding of React props and explore more advanced patterns for passing and managing data between components.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Css Clamp Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clamp) - This helped me resize my hero text across devices without having to write many CSS rules for different screen sizes. You can also check out- [5 CSS Tips & Tricks for better Responsive Web Design](https://youtu.be/2IV08sP9m3U?si=sHT3kG-kBc8ltGkt) on youtube as well... it was really helpful.

- [How to break an image out of its parent container with CSS](https://gomakethings.com/how-to-break-an-image-out-of-its-parent-container-with-css/) - This helped me understand how images can be positioned outside the viewport using negative margins for creative layout effects.
